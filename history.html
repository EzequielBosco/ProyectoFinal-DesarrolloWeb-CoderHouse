                <h4><b>1985–1992: Formation and first years</b></h4>
                <p>The members of Radiohead met while attending Abingdon School, an independent school for boys in Abingdon, Oxfordshire.[1] The guitarist and singer Thom Yorke and the bassist Colin Greenwood were in the same year; the guitarist Ed O'Brien and the drummer Philip Selway the year above; and Colin's brother, the multi-instrumentalist Jonny Greenwood, two years below. In 1985, they formed On a Friday, the name referring to their usual rehearsal day in the school's music room. Jonny was the last to join, first on harmonica and then keyboards, but soon became lead guitarist;[2] he had previously been in another band, Illiterate Hands, with musician Nigel Powell and Yorke's brother Andy Yorke.[3] According to Colin, the band members picked their instruments because they wanted to play together, rather than through any particular interest: "It was more of a collective angle, and if you could contribute by having someone else play your instrument, then that was really cool."[4] At one point, On a Friday featured a saxophone section.[5]</p>
                <h4>1992–1994: "Creep", Pablo Honey and early success</h4>
                <p>Radiohead recorded their debut EP, Drill, with Hufford and Edge at Courtyard Studios. Released in May 1992, its chart performance was poor.[2] As it was difficult for major labels such as EMI to promote bands in the UK, where independent labels dominated the indie charts, Radiohead's managers planned to have Radiohead use American producers and tour aggressively in America, then return to build a following in the UK.[16] Paul Kolderie and Sean Slade, who had worked with US indie bands Pixies and Dinosaur Jr., were enlisted to produce Radiohead's debut album, recorded quickly in Oxford in 1992.[2] With the release of their debut single, "Creep", that September, Radiohead began to receive attention in the British music press, not all of it favourable; NME described them as "a lily-livered excuse for a rock band",[17] and "Creep" was blacklisted by BBC Radio 1 as "too depressing".[18]</p>
                <h4>1994–1995: The Bends, critical recognition and growing fanbase</h4>
                <p>Radiohead began work on their second album in 1994 with the veteran Abbey Road Studios producer John Leckie. Tensions were high, with mounting expectations to match the success of "Creep".[25] Recording felt unnatural in the studio, with the band having over-rehearsed the material.[26] Seeking a change of scenery, they toured the Far East, Australasia and Mexico and found greater confidence performing their new music live.[26] However, troubled by his new fame, Yorke became disillusioned with being "at the sharp end of the sexy, sassy, MTV eye-candy lifestyle" he felt he was helping to sell to the world.[27] The My Iron Lung EP and single, released in 1994, was Radiohead's reaction, marking a transition towards the greater depth they aimed for on their second album.[28] It was Radiohead's first collaboration with their future producer Nigel Godrich, then working under Leckie as an audio engineer,[29] and artist Stanley Donwood, who has produced all of Radiohead's artwork since.[13] Promoted through alternative radio stations, sales of My Iron Lung were better than expected, and suggested that the band had built a fanbase and were not one-hit wonders.[30]</p>
